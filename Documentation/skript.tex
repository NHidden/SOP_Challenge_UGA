    \subsection{Implemented methods}

    We have implemented multiple methods for solving the SOP Challenge namely an Exact Method and Particle Swarm Optimization Method as well as a Greedy Method and closely related variations of it. In the following we will discuss the latter methods since they have turned out to be the most stable methods in terms finding feasible solutions and computation time in our experiments. We will now give a short description of each of the methods. Tables with results for each of the methods can be found in \ref{results}.
